# TCP Port Scanner with Scapy 
In the project we have executed TCP Port Scanner in 2 different ways. 

FILENAME: proj.py 
Takes an IP, starting port number and ending port number as input and scans all the ports between the starting and ending port numbers (not including ending port number) and displays if the ports in the given range are open or not. 

FILENAME: mainx.py (code)
BASH SCRIPT: inp.sh 
Takes a website and port number as input. It displays if the given port number is open for that website. It also runs the curl command on the website and displays the information of its server.
